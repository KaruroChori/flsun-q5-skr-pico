> [!TIP]
> If you find yourself with the same board not working after trying to update from an older version of klipper, fret not!  
> Replacing it is not needed, you can just buy an STLINK programmer from aliexpress, and restore the original firmware before upgrading klipper.  
> It is likely some of the older versions had the bootloader for this board broken.

Why?
- Because the original mks robin nano 1.2 is semi-bricked and cannot accept upgrades via sd. This seems to be a common issue as I experienced it on two printers of the same model, and there are few references online.
- Support for tmc2209 with serial connection available.
- 2 PWM channels for fans.
- A significantly wider range of options in terms of connectivity.

Don't use as it is. The way I wired might be different from yours.  
I based my wiring on the functional equivalence in the default described by makerbase and bigthreetech documentations.  
However, it seems like the flsun q5 had the bed and extruder thermistors swapped, so take care of that when first testing it.
